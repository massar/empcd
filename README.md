EMPCd - Event Music Player Client daemon

This is empcd which can use /dev/input/event0 or other event devices to control
MPD (Music Player Daemon) directly using the MPC (Music Player Client) library
(libmpdclient) and other programs using simple system(2) execution usable for scripts.

empcd is suited for embedded devices (raspberry pi, pogoplug etc) as it has a very small footprint.

All kinds of devices that support 'input events' can be connected: (USB) keyboards, mouses etc.
